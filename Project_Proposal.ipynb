    "## Question / Need:\n",
    "NYC Metro system is among the busiest metro networks in the world according to (intelligenttransport.com).According to New Yorkâ€™s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Time square is the most used metro station in New York Metro network with over 65 million person passing through it's gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large number of people passing through current turnstile gates is ineffective. Therefore, our analysis will identify stations that need to upgrade turnstile mechanism to increase transportation effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "1- What are the top 10  highly used turnstile gate? \n",
    "\n",
    "2- On each line, Does people uses all turnstiles equally? (is it a flow distribution problem or a real need to upgrade)\n",
